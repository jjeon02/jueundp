                    <p>
                        Fleuron is a typographic flower-shaped element used as a tool for ornamentation and dividing contents.

                    <h3>History of Fleuron</h3><br>
                    <p>
                        During the Fourth Crusade, Eastern culture spread to Europe. Crusade headed to Constantinople instead of Jerusalem due to the funding problem, and they looted cultural assets and artworks. After numerous artifacts and assets were brought to Venice, and books from East containing Persian style spread to Europe via Italy. The early Arabesque pattern influenced the ornaments of European prints, resulting in more of a repetitive and systematic pattern. 
                        <br><br>
                        Fleuron is originated from metal types developed from Ratdolt’s miniature woodcuts. The oldest example of fleuron is one of Giovanni and Alberto Alvise brothers. Their Are Moriendi were bestsellers throughout the 15th century and used two types of fleurons. The commercial success of Are Moriendi opened up the new era for typographic ornaments, which still remains on the digital type.

                        My work indicates a Korean font design that reflects the historical Latin language and glyph. From 20 century lots of Korean manufacturers and designers made an attempt to somewhat imitation of Latin language at first and it continued to this day. Re-interpretation of the Latin-based alphabet is still valid considering the rise of the need for interpretation of not only words but also the typography design itself. They’re mostly seen on titles of books, movies, posters, logos, brands and so on.

                    <h3>What is Munjado?</h3><br>
                    <p>
                        Munjado is one of the many forms of Minwha — A Korean art form that is mostly used by more of the general public and lower class. Munjado consists of a Chinese character and surrounding decorative illustration relevant to the character. This type of art was transferred from China and developed in Korea. Usually, Munjado has the purpose of delivering the message of Confucianism or wishing for the luck based on relief faith that is based on individuals’ own blessing, usually financial and wealth.  
                        <br><br>
                        The most common form of munjado is Hyojaemunjado - a munjado that focuses on the values of Confucianist ideology. Hyojaemunjado were usually made into a folding screen containing 8 Chinese characters (孝悌忠信禮義廉恥) that are core values of Confucianism. The form of Hyojaemunjado changed throughout time and it can be organized in three different periods. First, it started out by putting illustrations inside the type. Second, the illustration replaced certain shapes of type and emerged as a painting form. Later, the abstraction started to appear on the later Hyojaemunjado.

                    <p>
                        Munjado is an interesting art form that shows a mix of typography and illustration. Ornaments complement the shape and meaning of typography, which could be interesting re-interpretation in modern times. However, munjado has been traditionally Chinese character, which I wanted to make a change.

                        Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:
                        <br><br>
                        “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”
                        The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.
                        <br><br>
                        The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative history of lorem ipsum.
